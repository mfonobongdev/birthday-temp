            for achieving the following: <br /> <br />
            1. Google OAuth APIs are used to perform a Single Sign On through
            Google, while doing so we ensure that the email provided by the
            Google Auth server is a valid user of the Yaraa system. <br />
            2. We use Google Drive APIs to retrieve file URLs and Ids of the
            files attached by the user into his/her Yaraa account. We also
            manage the permissions of these files through the drive APIs when
            the workflow on Yaraa attached to these files are in progress.
